Uh uh uh c'mon
Hah sicka than your average Poppa
Twist cabbage off instinct niggaz don't think shit stink
Pink gators my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn
Dead right if they head right Biggie there every night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underoos
Never lose never choose to bruise crews who
Do something to us talk go through us
Girls walk to us wanna do us screw us
Who us Yeah Poppa and Puff
Close like Starsky and Hutch stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M3
Bang every MC easily busily
Recently niggaz frontin' ain't sayin' nuttin'
So I just speak my piece
keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece
with my peeps
Packin' askin' who want it
You got it nigga flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit we on it
Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid
Biggie Biggie Biggie
can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid
I put hoes in NY onto DKNY
Miami D C prefer Versace
All Philly hoes dough and Moschino
Every cutie wit a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie meanin' who's really the shit
Them niggaz ride dicks Frank White push the sticks
On the Lexus LX four and a half
Bulletproof glass tints if I want some ass
Gon' blast squeeze first ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last a nigga rappin' 'bout blunts and broads
Tits and bras ménage à trois sex in expensive cars
I still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for no car payment
At my arraignment note for the plantiff
Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement
Face it not guilty that's how I stay filthy
Richer than Richie till you niggaz come and get me
Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid
Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid
I can fill ya wit real millionaire shit
Escargot my car go one sixty swiftly
Wreck it buy a new one
Your crew run run run your crew run run
I know you sick of this name brand nigga with
Flows girls say he's sweet like licorice
So get with this nigga it's easy
Girlfriend here's a pen call me round ten
Come through have sex on rugs that's Persian
Come up to your job hit you while you workin
For certain Poppa freakin' not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin' like rapper demo
Tell them hoe take they clothes off slowly
Hit 'em wit the force like Obi dick black like Toby
Watch me roam like Gobe lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe show me homey
Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid
Biggie Biggie Biggie
can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid
Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid
Biggie Biggie Biggie
can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid
Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
I guess that's why they broke and you're so paid
