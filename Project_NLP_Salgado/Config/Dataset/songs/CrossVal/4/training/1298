Do ya wanna get rocked
Let's get let's get let's get let's get
Rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothin'
In fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day
But daddy don't agree
'Cause when I try to get away he says
He got plans for me
Stop buggin' me
Don't shake my tree
He said
Who me
Not my style man
No way
C'mon get real
I'm sorry dad gotta disappear
Let's get the rock outta here
Seven-day weekend up all night
In at the deep end hang on tight
Won't take a minute won't take long
So get on in it come on come on come on
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
Let's go all the way get it night and day
C'mon let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Drivin' with my baby
To get her in the mood
She's dialin' through my radio
And I'm ready to make my move
But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll
And it really blew my groove
It was
It makes me wanna scream
That ain't my scene
Well I'm sorry girl here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question
Seven-day weekend up all night
In at the deep end hang on tight
It won't take a minute it won't take long
So get on in it come on come on come on
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
Let's go all the way get it night and day
C'mon let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked oh
All I wanna do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancin' with this broom
I feel lucky today
Hey look at that man
Do ya wanna get rocked
Do ya wanna get rocked
Oh it won't take you a minute
It won't take that long
So get on get with it
Oh c'mon everybody
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
Get on top baby
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
Do ya wanna Do ya wanna
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
Get on top of it
Let's get let's get let's get let's get rocked
Love to rock your body baby

Rock the night away
