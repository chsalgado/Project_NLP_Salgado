Take the children and yourself
And hide out in the cellar
By now the fighting will be close at hand
Don't believe the church and state
And everything they tell you
Believe in me I'm with the high command
Can you hear me Can you hear me running
Can you hear me running Can you hear me calling you
Can you hear me Can you hear me running
Can you hear me running Can you hear me calling you
There's a gun and ammunition
Just inside the doorway
Use it only in emergency
Better you should pray to God
The Father and the Spirit
Will guide you and protect from up here
Can you hear me Can you hear me running
Can you hear me running Can you hear me calling you
Can you hear me Can you hear me running
Can you hear me running Can you hear me calling you
Swear allegiance to the flag
Whatever flag they offer
Never hint at what you really feel
Teach the children quietly
For someday sons and daughters
Will rise up and fight while we stood still
Can you hear me Can you hear me running
Can you hear me running Can you hear me calling you
Can you hear me Can you hear me running
Can you hear me running Can you hear me calling you
Can you hear me Can you hear me running
Can you hear me running Can you hear me calling you
Can you hear me running
Hear me calling you
Hear me running babe
Hear me running
Calling you calling you
