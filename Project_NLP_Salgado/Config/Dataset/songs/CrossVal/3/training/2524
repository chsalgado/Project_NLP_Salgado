Yeah let's take 'em back
Uh-huh
Coming up I was confused my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing Check check out My Melody
I wanna live good so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin niggas had stole my bike
Different day same shit ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me I'm rap's M V P
And I ain't going nowhere so you can get to know me
G-G-G-G-G-Unit On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em kill a nigga on my song
And really do it that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey I know all about losses
I'm from Compton wear the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me I'm rap's M V P
And I ain't going nowhere so you can get to know me
From the beginning to the end losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game
Used to see Five-O throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0 it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know What's Going On like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion
I love you ma
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me I'm rap's M V P
And I ain't going nowhere so you can get to know me
