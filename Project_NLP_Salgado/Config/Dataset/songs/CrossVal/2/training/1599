They say misery
Loves company
We could start a company
And make misery
Frustrated Incorporated
Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to see
Put me out of my misery
I'd do it for you would you do it for me
We will always be busy making misery
We could build a factory
And make misery
We'll create the cure
We made the disease

Frustrated Incorporated
Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to see
Put me out of my misery
All you suicide kings and your drama queens
Forever after happily
Making misery
Did you satisfy your greed
Get what you need
Was it only envy
So empty
