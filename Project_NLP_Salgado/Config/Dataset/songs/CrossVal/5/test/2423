Uh
Fabolous
F-A-B
Poli Paul
Spencow baby
Says he wants you he says he needs you
It's real talking why not make him wait for you
If he really wants you if he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When it's a good boy
I mean a really really good boy
Why not let him lay with you
That's when you give it to him good
Dip it low pick it up slow
Roll it all around throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta pop ta pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say Oh
Dip it low pick it up slow
Roll it all around throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta pop ta pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say Oh
You’re getting bold he’s growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love growin' old
You think it's time
And you’re thinking of leaving but give it time
It's late at night he's coming home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hair let him know what's on
If you understand me y’all come on
All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move Move
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you wanna do Show her what you got daddy
All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move How to move
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you wanna do Show her what what you wanna do
Dip it low pick it up slow
Roll it all around throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta pop ta pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say Oh
Dip it low pick it up slow
Roll it all around throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta pop ta pop that thing Yeah uh yeah uh
I'm-a show you how to make your man say Oh
Baby girl the way you pop ta pop ta pop that thing
I might stop to shop and cop you things
You know I drop the top and hop that thing
Sometimes I stop my bop to pop my things
You sure know how to make a man say Oh
And how in the world can a man say No
When you grind it up on the wall wind it up like a doll
And you know I Bacardi Lime it up ‘till you fall
Line it up ‘till you spoiled
And have them other chicks throwin’ vomit it up
When they can find it up in the mall
Like most men I like to catch up with a model
But I ain’t used to movin’ slow like ketchup in a bottle
The best things come to those who wait for it
But I’m-a be straight forward before it’s too late for it
But I want you to dip it low pick it up slow
Roll it all around throw it out and make me say Oh
Dip it low pick it up slow
Roll it all around throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta pop ta pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say Oh
Dip it low pick it up slow
Roll it all around throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta pop ta pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say Oh
Dip it low pick it up slow
Roll it all around throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta pop ta pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say Oh
Dip it low pick it up slow
Roll it all around throw it out like your back broke
Pop ta pop ta pop that thing
I'm-a show you how to make your man say Oh
