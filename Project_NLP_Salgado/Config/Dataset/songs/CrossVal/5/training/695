Here I lay all alone
Tossin turning
Longing for some of your
Tender Love
I'm waiting for the right
moment to come
So I can thank you for
All the tender love you've given to me
Tender love Tender love
Love so tender love
Pulling me close to you
baby I surrender
Candles they light the dark
Now I see how lovely the feelings are
All the tender love you've given to me
I want you more and more
Can't resist you
Oh then I feel your touch
Tender love
And you're loving me straight from the heart
Hold me nearer
Please let me be a part
of the tend love you're giving to me
Tender love tender love
Love so tender
Holding me close to you
Baby I surrender
ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh whooo yeah

la la la la la la la la la
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
ohh tender love ohh ohh ohh
Please let me be a part
of the tender love you're giving to me
