Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
Make it come out right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight I know
Lord I know
Some people like to stay out late
Some folks can't hold out that long
But nobody wants to go home now
There's too much goin' on
This night is gonna last forever
Last all last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up
The radio is gonna play that song
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Lord I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
The moon's shinin' bright
So turn out the light and we'll get it right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Heartache baby
Somebody's gonna hurt someone
Somebody
Before the night is through
Somebody's gonna come undone
There's nothin' we can do
Everybody
Everybody wants to touch somebody
If it takes all night
Everybody wants to take a little chance
To make it come out right
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
There's gonna be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know
Let's go
We can beat around the bushes
we can get down to the bone
We can leave it in the parkin' lot
But either way there's gonna be
A heartache tonight a heartache tonight
Oh I know
There'll be a heartache tonight
A heartache tonight I know whoo hoo
Break my heart
