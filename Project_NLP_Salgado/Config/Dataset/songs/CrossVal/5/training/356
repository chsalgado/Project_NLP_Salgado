Gloria
You're always on the run now
Running after somebody
You gotta get him somehow
I think you've got to slow down
Before you start to blow it
I think you're headed for a breakdown
So be careful not to show it
You really don't remember
Was it something that he said
All the voices in your head
Calling Gloria
Gloria
Don't you think you're fallin'
If everybody wants you
Why isn't anybody callin'
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line
Oh-oh-oh
Calling Gloria
Gloria Gloria
I think they got your number Gloria
I think they got the alias Gloria
That you've been living under Gloria
But you really don't remember
Was it something that they said
All the voices in your head
Calling Gloria
A-ha-ha a-ha-ha Gloria
How's it gonna go down
Will you meet him on the main line
Or will you catch him on the rebound
Will you marry for the money
Take a lover in the afternoon
Feel your innocence slipping away
Don't believe it's comin' back soon
And you really don't remember
Was it something that he said
All the voices in your head
Calling Gloria
Gloria
Don't you think you're fallin'
If everybody wants you
Why isn't anybody callin'
You don't have to answer
Leave them hangin' on the line
Oh-oh-oh
Calling Gloria
Gloria Gloria
I think they got your number Gloria
I think they got the alias Gloria
That you've been living under Gloria
But you really don't remember
Was it something that they said
Are the voices in your head
Calling Gloria
Gloria Gloria Gloria Gloria Gloria
