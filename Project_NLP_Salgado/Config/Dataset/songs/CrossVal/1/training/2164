Intro
Baby let me explain to you I'm sayin
What you sayin
It's not even like that
It wasn't like that But I saw you
Baby I don't love her
You don't love me
You know what I don't even want to talk to you
She don't mean nothing to me
I don't want to see ya face
She was just telling me--
I just want to see you walking through that door
Baby don't--
there ain't nothing else to say
Why we gotta do it like this
Peace
Baby--DAMN
Verse 1
Come home late
It seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gon get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So if you want some lovin I suggest you go back there
Where you came from
Day to Day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse
See I
Chorus
heard it all before
All of ya lies all of ya sweet talk
Baby this Baby that
down
played the fool before
I was your fool I believed in you
Yes I did yes I did
down
Verse 2
What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Got me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do
And there's nothing you can say
That could persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out
I am no longer concerned
See I
Chorus
heard it all before
Let me explain baby it's not what you think
That's what you said to me
had to shut you down
Now I
played the fool before
You got a good game I must admit I was it but now it's over
down
Bridge
Use to hang on to your every word every word
But the more you lie to me the more I hurt
The things you use to say would sound so sweet sound so sweet
I was naive
Quick to believe
Chorus
Heard it all before
I was at work It wasn't my car you saw Baby I swear it wasn't me
down
played the fool before
You were my boo I trusted you for way too long way too long
now
You know you messed up You got to know you messed up
You got to go now say what you want
down down down down
Played the fool
I done change the locks on the door Yes I did
And you ain't welcome no more You ain't welcome no more
look who's hurting now
See I heard it all before
