Uh-huh yeah 2x
Uh uh-huh yeah 4x
Yeah
Hear my cries hear my call
Lend me your ears see my fall
See my error know my faults
Time halts see my loss
Know I'm lacking backtracking
Where I met you pistol packing
Itchy finger trigger happy
Try to trap me bad rap
Wiretap me backstab me
Break the faith fall from grace
Tell me lies time flies
Close your eyes come with me
Come with me
Yeah
Come with me
Uh-huh yeah
Yeah
You said to trust you you'd never hurt me
Now I'm disgusted since then adjusted
Certainly you fooled me ridiculed me
Left me hangin' now shit's boomerangin'
Right back at ya think long-ranged
Narrow minded left me blinded
I co-signed it shit backfired
But I'm bouncin' back I grinded
Not many would bear the pressure you comprehend me
You musn't end me you offend me
It's trauma feel the drama
Come with me
Yeah
Uh-huh
Heh-heh
Come with me
Don't be afraid
Yeah
Come with me
I close my eyes
And I see
You standing there
I cry
Tears of sorrow
I die
Uh-huh
Yeah
Fuck my enemies fuck my foes
Damn these hoes is steppin' on my toes
Back up off me take your hands off me
Give me room to breathe
I'm not hearin' it I'm not fearin' it
I'm up to my ears in it bullshit
I'm destructive some women find that seductive
Some say it's lunacy but luckily I've been movin' on
I ignore you sorry if I call you
I neglect you don't mean to disrespect you
Can't you see I love you dearly
And not sincerely but you annoy me
You can't avoid me I'm here to stay
Forever and ever in a day that's never
I can't let you go I can't forget it
Why you did it I won't permit it
I won't acquit it I wanna to fight you
I'll fuckin' bite you can't stand nobody like you
You can't run you can't hide
No surprise close your eyes

See my errors know my faults
Time halts see my loss

Wiretap me backstab me
Break the faith fall from grace
Tell me lies time flies
