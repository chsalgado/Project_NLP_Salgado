Well me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon lights
The corner bar
It just seemed right so I pulled up
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end lookin' half asleep
He walked up and said What'll it be
I said The good stuff
He didn't reach around for the whiskey
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said You can't find that here
'Cause its the first long kiss on a second date
Your momma's all worried when you get home late
Droppin' the ring in the spaghetti plate
'Cause your hands are shakin so much
And it's the way that she looks with rice in her hair
Eatin' burnt suppers the whole first year
And askin' for seconds to keep her from tearin' up
Yeah man that's the good stuff
He grabbed a carton of milk
And he poured a glass
Then I smiled and said
I'll have some of that
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends
Saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said That's my Bonnie taken 'bout a year after we wed
He said Spent five years in the bottle when the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
'Cause the one thing stronger than the whiskey
Was the sight of her holdin' my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new t-shirt saying I'm a grandpa
And being right there as our time got small
And holdin' her hand when the good Lord called her up
Yeah man that's the good stuff
He said When you get home she'll start to cry
When she says 'I'm sorry ' say 'So am I'
Then look into those eyes so deep in love
And drink it up
'Cause thats the good stuff
That's the good stuff
